  "mainContent": "twinme is a free  secure instant messaging and High-Definition voice/video call application, protecting your privacy and giving you full control over each of your relationships and contents.WHY USE TWINME:. PRIVACY BY DESIGN: twinme doesn’t ask, store, or use any of your personal data. You do not need to subscribe and provide any personal information to use twinme.twinme is about the only messaging app that does not use your phone number (no email address or social network ID either), and that does not snoop into your address book to suck your contacts’ phone number and other private information.. PERSONALIZED CONTACTS: you can choose what you disclose about yourself to each of your twinme contact individually: your name, your image, which you can change at any time. You control how each of your contacts can reach you (or not). Since your contact information is personal to each of your contacts, it cannot be transferred to nor used by anyone else. You are in full control, whether you interact with a close friend or a complete stranger.. PERSONALISED CALLS: twinme video calls allow your contact to see you in live video BEFORE accepting the call. You can thus create a live emotional preview of your call by simply long pressing the video call button.. PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS: all conversations happen in peer-to-peer with no relay server storing contents in-between devices. Data exchanged always stay within devices. Messages and voice/video calls are end-to-end encrypted . You clear all messages of a conversation on both ends simultaneously in one tap.. FAST MESSAGING AND HIGH DEFINITION VOICE/VIDEO CALLS: twinme peer-to-peer message transfers are instantaneous when both ends have an active data connection.twinme voice and video calls leverage the latest state-of-the-art real-time multimedia protocols and codecs that adapt to device configurations and changing network conditions to provide the highest quality voice and video definition achievable on the market today.. FREE WITH NO ADVERTISING: since twinme does not access any of yours or your contacts personal information, it cannot be used for commercial purposes. Unlike most other messaging apps, you are not a product.. INTERACT ONLINE LIKE IN REAL LIFE: you are free to decide with whom, when and how you interact. Have one of your profiles’ invitation twincodes (QR-Code) scanned by a friend next to you or someone you just met, or send it by text, email or any other means to a family away, or post it to your website or tweet it to your followers: you decide.If you don’t want to continue a relationship any further just remove it from your twinme contact list, and he/she cannot reach you anymore: no unsolicited call, no harassment, no spam are possible with twinme.. IDEAL FOR KIDS: twinme helps you turn any tablet into a safe communication device for children. Without a phone number, your kid cannot discover or be discovered on line by unknown people. The only contacts allowed are those met in person (family and friends) that can flash the kid profile twincode (QR-code) with their device. Parents feel comfortable and kids can enjoy their first grownup social app safely.. UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY: twinme extends the WebRTC open source technology (the new standard for secure real-time peer-to-peer multimedia exchanges on the web) with its unique twincode relationships model to provide the most disruptive communications services on the market today.twinme uses your device Internet connection (WiFi or 3G/4G/LTE as available). Data charges may therefore apply. Check your carrier for details.PERMISSIONS: . “Camera” & “Microphone” to take pictures, make voice/video calls . \"Photos/Media/Files\" for profiles or messages. \"Storage\" to access files on SD cards. \"network connections\" to monitor connections. \"audio settings\" for audio volume. \"prevent from sleeping\" when in a voice/video call. \"vibration\" to give feedback. \"run at startup\" to receive message/call\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

Touch VPN – the free unlimited VPN – is the best solution for you! 100% free. No credit card information needed. No trials offered. Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations.   Unblock the world with just one touch of the “Connect” button.   Our strong SSL encryption will make you fully anonymous and secured. We want to be one of the best VPN choices for you, and are always open to feedbacks and suggestions. Just shoot an email to support@northghost.com!Get Touch VPN Now! And if you love us, don’t forget to spread the love by giving us 5-stars!-------------------------------------------VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to the server in another country. Because of the encryption process the data cannot be filtered or blocked. If you live in Sweden for example, when connect to a VPN server in US, your traffic would look like coming from the United States, instead of Sweden. With a VPN, you are not only able to unblock geo-restricted or censored services, such as Facebook, Pandora and Youtube; your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web completely anonymously.VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic and change your IP. A Proxy server is however, completely browser based, whether you are using Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic, and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online freedom, privacy and security.Touch VPN is 100% free, unlimited, secured and super easy to use. You can connect to any of the servers below (Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, United States, Netherlands, and Canada) to enjoy unlimited online privacy and freedom. With Touch VPN you can  Bypass geo-restrictions to unblock any website wherever you are! Get access to sites that are blocked or censored by government, school or workplace. Evade firewalls to unblock Facebook, watch YouTube, and circumvent VOIP limitations. Touch VPN unblocks it all with its free VPN app When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many anonymous servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your devices battery. And, we are a completely unlimited and free VPN!Avoid being snooped by your ISP and prevent websites from ad tracking and targeting. Touch VPN changes your IP address, so your online identity is anonymous and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.-----------------------------Big shout of thank you to users who love us and spread their love. Join the millions who are using Touch VPN!\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

  "mainContent": "Many apps can access your private information on your device (e.g. read your contacts or get your current location). This information is used for various purposes. However, it is often not clear to the end-user what those purposes are. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to see exactly what information the different apps on your device can access.\r Additionally, apps often include advertisement and analytic libraries that send away private information to third-party services. Information about those services is often hidden inside a long user-agreement that is not read by the user.\r  The SRT Privacy Inspector was developed to gain more insight on what private information an app accesses. Therefore, it analyzes which permissions an app uses and how risky those permissions are. Additionally, every app is checked for advertisement and analytic libraries, to inspect which information is send to third-party services.\r  Features:\r - Analyses every app on your device (only free apps on the latest Android versions, since paid apps are not readable).\r - Displays information about third-party advertisement and analytic libraries for each app.\r - Assigns a 'risk score' to each app (based on the requested permissions).\r - Shows statistics about the used advertisement and analytic libraries and what private information they try to access.\r - added symbols to indicate if a permission is dangerous or normal\r- improved stability\r- fixed errors in the license agreement\r\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\n",

Safe Dots will be visible even on your lock screen. Configuring the App is as simple as enabling the Safe Dots Accessibility Service (Toggle switch in the App > (More) Downloaded Services/Installed Services > Dot > Enable). By default, the App is configured to show iOS 14 style coloured access dots - green for camera access, orange for microphone access. The App itself does not request for the camera or microphone access so, don't worry!. The app displays Safe Dots whenever the phone's camera or microphone is engaged by a third-party App. The App uses Accessibility Service to detect the app that is trying to use your device hardware (such as Camera or Microphone). You'll be required to enable the Accessibility permission in the app so app can work as intended. All the data collected by Accessibility service will be stored on your device and will be erased when app is removed or data is cleared.Maintain an Access Log, which can be accessed from the App's main settings screen. The Access Log shows when the camera/microphone was accessed, which App was in the foreground at the time of access initiation and how long did the access last.\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\n",

  "mainContent": "This brain teasing game will give you tons of fun with special designed levels.Like many other versions of the game, the principles of Mayan Secret do not stray too far away from the original game but the layout and way the game is played do.Mayan Secret has been made successful thanks to a game called Mahjong, requiring players to master the art of concentration and strategic thinking in order to remove all the tiles from the board. The aim of this Mayan Solitaire is very similar to other versions of Mahjong Solitaires; if you are unfamiliar with the overall objective then it is very simple to understand: You must think that this is like a puzzle. Clear the layout of tiles by selecting matching pairs of tiles, resulting in a clear board.Only two tiles can be removed from the board at a time, these tiles must be identically matching. The next part is what makes the game difficult – tiles can only be removed if they connected by a maximum of three lines. Tiles joined by horizontal and vertical lines but not diagonal and lines may cross over an empty border. Every move can affect a future one so it is important to think ahead when selecting your pairs.The game is over when tiles are left on the board but further moves are not possible.Challenge every aspect of your brain to be the first one to clear all thousand levels!\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

  "mainContent": "☆  Photos and videos imported into phone can only be viewed or played after the correct password is entered. These photos and videos can also be backed up to Cloud Space for better protection.☆ Use App Lock to protect your social, photo, call logs and telephone apps to prevent privacy leak.☆ With Private browser, your internet surf will leave no traces behind. There is also Private Bookmark feature.☆ Back up your SMS, contacts and call logs, photos and videos to Cloud so they never get lost.☆ With Cloud Backup feature, you can easily transfer your data to a new phone.☆  Worried about forgetting your password? Set a security email in Vault so you can retrieve it.► Create multiple vaults with different passwords for storing photos, videos or private contacts respectively. And one of them can be a fake vault.► Make Vault icon disappear from your home screen and it can only be found again with the correct password, so no one knows it exists.► Secretly snaps a picture of any one who attempts to access with a wrong password. Vault captures a photo, the time stamp and PIN code entered by all intruders.► If you have a security Email set up before, you should be able to see a \"Forgot Password\" en-trance once you input the wrong password. Tap on the entrance and follow the instructions to reset your password. If you do not have a security Email but you had backed up your data to cloud space, then the data can be recovered from the cloud by reinstalling Vault app.In stealth mode, you can enter Vault: 1. Put Vault back to the phone’s home screen by adding Vault widget, once it appears on home screen, tap on it, and then input your password to enter, or, 2. Download \"NQ calculator\" in Google Play, open it, and input correct password then tap \"=\". Some cleaning or free storage apps may automatically delete Vault’s data folder used to store pictures and videos. So, as a best practice, please do not choose to delete Vault’s data folder and subfolders (mnt/sdcard/SystemAndroid) when you use such apps. You can also backup your sms, pictures and videos to cloud by using \"Cloud Backup\" feature in the premium page of Vault.After the backup, you won’t have to worry about accidentally deleting stored pic-tures/videos/sms or other data, and you can always restore data from the cloud whenever you need.For more questions or comments,Email: vault@nq.com► Vault – hide pics&videos, sms, lock app @nqvaultappThis app uses the Device Administrator permission.\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

  "mainContent": "A VPN is a tool to encrypt your system and maintain your privacy.A VPN application allows users to send and receive data over a private network when using a public network. A VPN allows users to connect securely and remain private on the network. The encrypted connection allows data to pass through Internet traffic while protecting user data.Why use a VPN and how does it protect you?1. Confidentiality is your right- Privacy is a fundamental right. It is your right to keep your data or that of your company or organization private and secure.- Confidentiality on the Internet is a necessity. A VPN is an ideal means of protection for your personal and organizational data.2. Prevent browsers from following you- A VPN secures the use of browsers, because your searches will not be followed by browsers. There are many free browsers, such as Google. However, these browsers record your data.- Hackers can find your information by hacking free browsers. When using a VPN, you can hide your IP address and avoid being hacked.3. Secure your streaming- A VNP offers the ability to view content from anywhere. For example, if you live in France and want to watch TV series and content only available in the United States, you can use a VPN to access this content, because a VPN allows you to give the impression that you are in the USA.- Many apps restrict browsing by location, but with a VPN, you can view content from anywhere.4. Safe use of public wireless access points Wireless access points, like those found in most cafes or airports, are known to hackers. A VPN will add security to your device, secure wireless access found in public spaces. 5. VPN offers better VOIP - VOIP stands for voice over IP. Skype and Google Hangouts are free calling services. Although the use of these services seems secure, it is important to know that they can be hacked. - A VPN can prevent people from hacking and intercepting telephone conversations. Business information is often shared on VOIP storage, and because of this, large companies secure their conversations by using a VPN. 6. For added security - It is possible to secure your data with a VPN. All data can be protected using a VPN: employee photos, personal files and corporate financial records. - Our lives are changing online today, and using a VPN provides encryption and increased security when transferring data from one computer to another.The advantages of using a VPN:1. Increased security:- A VPN offers many advantages and increases your online security and privacy. A VPN also protects you from hackers and unwanted attention.- A VPN allows users to access various locations and protects data from potential threats. When using public wireless networks, using a VPN provides added security and hides your IP address; its encryption prevents intrusions.2. Remote access:This is one of the best benefits of a VPN: you can access your data remotely.3. A VPN hides your online identity:A VPN protects you by hiding your IP address. Otherwise, hackers could easily hack into your account and see your personal information.\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

  "mainContent": " Vivaldi is a new, free, and private web browser built with flexibility in mind. It comes packed with useful features including a built-in AdBlocker (pop-up blocker), tracking protection, and private translation. Browser options like proper desktop-style tabs, dark/light Themes, and layout choices help you make it yours.Download a private Android web browser app for free now! 🕵️‍♂️  Your web browser, your business. We don't track how you use Vivaldi and private incognito tabs mean you can keep your Internet browsing history to yourself. Searches, links, sites visited, cookies, and temporary files won't be stored when you use private tabs.⛔️   A built-in adblocker blocks privacy-invading ads and stops trackers from following you around the Internet - no extensions needed. P.S. AdBlocker and pop-up blocker also make your browser safer and faster.💡  Choose between using a Tab Bar (which works great on larger screens and tablets) or a Tab Switcher to manage tabs. In the Tab Switcher you can quickly swipe to find open tabs, private tabs, and tabs you’ve recently closed in the browser or have open on another device.🏃‍♀️  Browse faster by adding your favorite bookmarks as Speed Dials on the new tab page to keep them one tap away, for faster internet browsing on Android. Sort them into folders, pick from a bunch of layout options, and make it your own. You can also switch Search Engines on the fly using Search Engine Nicknames while typing in Vivaldi’s Address Field (like \"d\" for DuckDuckGo or \"w\" for Wikipedia).🛠  Vivaldi comes with built-in tools so you get better app performance and spend less jumping between apps to get things done. Here's a taste:- Get private translations of websites using Vivaldi Translate (powered by Lingvanex).- Take Notes as you browse and sync them securely between all your devices.- Capture screenshots of a full page (or just the visible area) and share them quickly.- Scan QR Codes to share links between devices.- Use Page Actions to adjust webpage content with filters.🍦  Vivaldi is also available on Windows, Mac and Linux! Pick-up where you left off by syncing data across devices. Open tabs, saved logins, Bookmarks and Notes seamlessly sync to all your devices using end-to-end encryption and can be further secured by an encryption password. - Internet browser with encrypted Sync- Free built-in AdBlocker with pop-up blocker- Page Capture- Speed Dial shortcuts for favorites- Free Tracker Blocker for privacy protection- Notes with rich text support- Private tabs (for incognito private browsing)- Dark Mode- Bookmarks Manager- QR Code Scanner- External Download manager support- Recently closed tabs- Search engine nicknames- Reader View- Clone tab- Page Actions- Language Selector- Downloads Manager- Auto-clear browsing data on exit- WebRTC leak (for privacy)- Cookie banner blocking- 🕹 Built-in Arcade✌️  Vivaldi is the most feature-packed, customizable Internet browser for Android that has two ground rules: privacy is a default, and everything's an option. We don't track you and believe private and secure software should be the rule, not the exception. You choose how Vivaldi works, what features to use and how it looks. This is your browser, after all.To get the most out of Vivaldi, sync up with our desktop version (available on Windows, macOS and Linux). It's free and has a lot of cool stuff that we think you'll love. Get it at: vivaldi.com—Take web browsing on Android to the next level with Vivaldi browser!

First enable the developer settings on your device(on older versions it is not needed).\r To enable the developer settings go to settings > about phone > and click on the android version about 7 times.\r 2. in the developer options enable mock locations.\r 3. set your location to be 'device only'(use only gps location).\r 4. open the app, move the red dot anywhere you like and click on the 'play button'.\r  Important notes:\r  - This fake location app requires to have google play services, and google maps installed.\r - It might not work with some apps, but it works with fb,whatsapp,twitter, and other apps.\r - it doesn't work with viber since it requiters network location enabled. \r - if the app stops working, or behaving strangely then simply restart the device.\r  Feel free to contact me by email for anything regarding this app.\r\nThis app passed the security test for virus, malware and other malicious attacks and doesn't contain any threats.\nThese reviews and ratings come from Aptoide app users.

  "mainContent": "This tool will let you deceive your GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and set any location in the earth. Your phone will believe that it is in totally different place than it will be in fact (e.g. romantic Paris, modern New York or exotic Bangkok).You only have to point new position on the map and start fake GPS. Most running games and applications will be receiving information about mock location and your real coordinates will be hidden. If you want your fake location to be more reliable you can use a simulation of movement. Choose the kind of movement (on foot, by car or by plane) and direction which you want to move in. Your latitude and longitude will start changing.Why do I need this application?There are many possibilities of using this application. You can e.g. brag on social networks that you were on a very expensive trip on Caribbean or another exotic place.How does it work?Android devices have settings for developers. One of these settings is deceiving GPS coordinates in order to test new applications using GPS position. Our tool uses this option and thanks to it most applications installed on your phone don't see your real coordinates but the fake one, chosen by you.What to do to set new GPS location?Apart from installing our application you also have to do some adjustments in settings of your phone. Our application has graphic instructions presenting what you have to do step by step. In brief you have to:1. If you have mobile phone with Android 4.2 (or above) version first you have to activate developer hidden menu.2. After that you have to find option \"Mock location\" and choose \"Fake GPS Location PRO\" from the list of available applications. Now you can start our tool, set new location pointing it on the map and press \"Play\".

On top of that, the more complex we are forced to make those passwords, the harder it is to simply memorize all of them. Why you are undeniably more vulnerable to password hackers than you have been in the past, this does not mean that there is nothing that you can do about it. A strong password that is memorized, never reused, and never shared with anyone, is a very secure password.
